Project Alert: GitHub ID Fetcher
Project Overview:

The GitHub ID Fetcher is a web-based tool designed to help users easily retrieve information about GitHub user profiles by simply entering their GitHub username. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project aims to provide a seamless experience for accessing user-specific details, such as their profile ID, repositories, followers, and other essential GitHub data.
Features:

    GitHub User ID Fetching: Users can enter any GitHub username, and the tool will fetch the GitHub user’s ID and other relevant details.
    Real-time Data Display: Using JavaScript, the fetched data is dynamically displayed on the webpage without needing to reload.
    Responsive Design: The project is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring smooth operation across different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
    Styled with CSS: A clean and user-friendly interface has been built using CSS to make the GitHub ID Fetcher visually appealing and easy to navigate.
    Interactive UI: The JavaScript functionality enhances the user experience by providing instant feedback and displaying the results immediately after the user inputs the GitHub username.

Key Technologies Used:

    HTML: Provides the structure for the webpage, including the input field, buttons, and sections for displaying the fetched data.
    CSS: Ensures the page has a modern and clean design, focusing on user experience and visual appeal.
    JavaScript: Handles the dynamic interaction, fetching the data via GitHub’s API and updating the webpage without requiring a page reload.

How It Works:

    The user enters a GitHub username into the input field.
    Upon clicking the Fetch ID button, a JavaScript function sends a request to the GitHub API to retrieve the corresponding user's details.
    The data fetched from GitHub (such as user ID, name, avatar, and number of repositories) is then displayed on the page in a clear and readable format.

Use Cases:

    GitHub Developers: Ideal for developers who want to quickly view GitHub user data.
    Project Managers: Can use the tool to check on team members' GitHub profiles and repositories.
    Open-source Contributors: Quickly access the profile of contributors on various open-source projects.
